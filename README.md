To use the webpages, run all the commands found in sql/database.sql in a localhost or server. This will load the database, tables, columns, and inserted information, which the webpages depend. Then, switch out any locations that say "GoogleMapsAPIKey" with your key. After this is complete, the webpages will be able to run in a localhost environment or on a server.
